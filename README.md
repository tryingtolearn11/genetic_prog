<h1> Part One: Evolving Sentences </h1>
<p> genetic programming stuff </p>
<p> inspired from Shiffman's Nature of Code </p>

Given a Random String (Sentence), We can evolve a pool of species mimicking
natural selection in order to find the String of Best Fit.

<h1>Part Two: Evolving Images</h1>
Given an image (preferably small dimensions ~50 x 70 as an example), can we evolve a set of randomized triangles into the image?
<h2> Can we replicate Mona Lisa using 150 triangles? </h2>
